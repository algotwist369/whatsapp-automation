   ```

2. **Configure Redis**
   ```bash
   # Make sure Redis is running
   redis-server
   ```

3. **Test with Small Batch First**
   ```
   Test with 5-10 contacts → 
   Verify messages are unique →
   Check spam scores →
   Then scale up
   ```

4. **Monitor Resources**
   ```
   CPU Usage: Keep < 80%
   Memory Usage: Keep < 80%
   Redis: Check connection
   MongoDB: Check pool size
   ```

### Best Practices

1. **Message Writing**
   - Avoid spam words

   - Use AI analysis before sending

2. **Contact Management**
   - Categorize contacts
   - Add relevant tags
   - Keep phone numbers updated
   - Remove inactive contacts

3. **Campaign Planning**
   - Start with small batch (10-20)
   - Monitor success rate
   - Adjust delays if needed
   - Scale gradually

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Quick Fixes
```bash
# If Redis not running
redis-server

# Check API key and quota

# If WhatsApp disconnects
# Reconnect in UI (auto-restores)

# If queue stuck
# Restart backend
npm run dev
```

### Common Issues

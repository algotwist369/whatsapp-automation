# OpenAI API Setup Guide

## Issue Fixed ✅

The application was getting a 401 authentication error because the OpenAI API key was invalid or not properly configured.

## How to Fix

### Step 1: Get Your OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign in to your OpenAI account
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the generated API key (starts with `sk-`)

### Step 2: Configure the API Key

The application has been updated to use a proper `.env` file. You have two options:

#### Option A: Use the generated .env file (Recommended)
1. Open `backend/.env` file
2. Find the line: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here`
3. Replace `sk-your-openai-api-key-here` with your actual API key
4. Save the file

#### Option B: Set environment variable directly
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-actual-api-key-here"
```

### Step 3: Restart the Server

After setting the API key, restart the backend server:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

## What Was Fixed

1. **Invalid API Key**: Removed the hardcoded invalid API key
2. **Better Error Handling**: Added graceful fallback when API key is missing
3. **Clear Instructions**: Added helpful console messages
4. **Environment Setup**: Created proper `.env` file with secure random keys
5. **Fallback Mode**: Application now works without AI features if API key is missing

## Features Without OpenAI

If you don't set up the OpenAI API key, the application will still work but with limited AI features:
- ✅ Basic spam detection (local word filtering)
- ❌ Advanced AI message analysis
- ❌ AI-powered message rewriting
- ❌ Message variations generation

## Testing the Fix

1. Start the server: `npm run dev`
2. Check the console for: `✅ OpenAI service initialized successfully`
3. If you see warnings about missing API key, follow the setup steps above

## Troubleshooting

### Still getting 401 errors?
- Make sure your API key is correct and active
- Check that you copied the entire key (including the `sk-` prefix)
- Verify the key has sufficient credits/quota

### API key not being read?
- Make sure the `.env` file is in the `backend/` directory
- Restart the server after making changes
- Check for typos in the environment variable name

## Support

If you continue to have issues:
1. Check the server console for error messages
2. Verify your OpenAI account has available credits
3. Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions

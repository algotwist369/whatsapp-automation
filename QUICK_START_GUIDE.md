Recommended: 60 seconds (balanced)
Safe: 90 seconds (slower, lower risk)

```

❌ Disable AI Personalization

```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: High Spam Score

**Solution**: Use AI analysis before sending. The system auto-rewrites problematic content.

```bash
# Check spam score
1. Write message
2. Click "Analyze with AI"
3. Review score
4. Use rewritten version if score > 40
```

### Issue: WhatsApp Disconnected

**Solution**: Reconnect in WhatsApp settings. System auto-restores on restart.

```bash
# Check connection
1. Go to WhatsApp Settings
2. Check status indicator
3. Click "Connect" if needed
4. Scan QR code
```

### Issue: Messages Not Sending

**Checklist**:
- [ ] WhatsApp connected?
- [ ] Redis running?
- [ ] Contacts selected?
- [ ] Phone numbers valid?
- [ ] Check console logs

### Issue: Slow Performance

**Solutions**:
```typescript
// Option 1: Increase concurrency (in production.ts)
messageQueue: {
  concurrency: 10 → 15 // Max recommended: 20
}

// Option 2: Reduce delay (in user settings)
messageDelay: 60s → 45s // Min: 30s

// Option 3: Check system resources
- CPU usage < 80%
- Memory usage < 80%
- Redis connected
```
